# Project on computational complexity theory

The task is to implement AKS primality test and compare it to other primality tests.

## Getting Started

You don't need any other tool to see everything done, but if you want to test it yourself you will need to have python 3 and libraries, listed below.  

In the 'research' folder you can find source code used during the research.  

In the 'scripts' folder you can find source code for every test used in the task. To use scripts clone the repo and follow instructions, written in the 'scripts' folder.  

'paper.pdf' contains theoretical information and a report on a done job.  

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* numpy
* scipy
* time
* matplotlib
